I have been a CS professor at BYUâ€“Hawaii for 16 years, and throughout that time I have had the privilege of mentoring and teaching students around the world in the field, especially students from areas with limited opportunities. While I am a tenured faculty member, I still desire to pursue new knowledge through software development and research.

My research interests are in mobile sensing. Mobile and ubiquitous devices present opportunities for passively collecting health data alongside active health assessments. Using modern AI techniques, this data can predict health events and provide interventions. In my research, I am focusing on the HCI side of passive and active data collection that supports these systems. By developing a mobile sensing framework consisting of iOS and Android applications with a cloud storage system used in a field study, I submitted a paper that proposes design guidelines for mobile sensing.

I am using the framework and guidelines for several health-related projects, including: studying meth and other substance addictions in the native Hawaiian population, the effects of screen time on sleep in kids, and cardio fitness in cancer survivors. I am developing a system to collect screen time from mobile devices, and to be able to collect health data from wearable devices. As I move further into my research, I plan on supporting AI/human interactions to improve mobile sensing systems.

I am excited to use my web and mobile development experinece in new ways to explore how mobile sesning, AI, and HCI can be combined to improve health outcomes.
