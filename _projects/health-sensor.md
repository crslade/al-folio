In coordination with the [Hawaii Digital Health lab](https://hawaiidigitalhealthlab.com) at the University of Hawaii - Manoa, I have been working on several projects. They include the following:

* Mobile Passive Sensing in the Wild
* Collecting FitBit Data in a study to help meth users fit addiction.
* iPad Screentime collection.
