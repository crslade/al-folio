In coordination with the [Hawaii Digital Health lab](https://peterwashington.github.io) at the University of Hawaii - Manoa, we are conducting a study to see how screen time and study habits affect the mental health of college students. The health sensor app is designed to collect this data securely and privately.

# Privacy Policy 

Our number one priority is to make sure that your privacy is maintained throughout the study. To ensure your privacy, ALL DATA will be anonymous. The mobile app will generate a unique identifier for each participant, but there will be no way to connect that identifier with you (the participant). You cannot see the identifier within the app nor will the identifier be shared with your instructor. The research team will never be able to connect you with this identifier. Your name, email, course, or any other personally identifiable information will not be associated with this identifier.

# What do I need to do?

All you need to do to participate in this study is install the app. The app will request your consent to participate in the study. (The consent information is also provided below.) The app will request to use your location (see below), but **it will only use your location when you enter or exit the library**. You can then check in by reporting whether you are happy, ok, or sad. The app will send daily notifications reminding you to check in each day. You can see your progress on the app. After 30 days, the study will be finished and you can take a screenshot of your app and submit it to your instructor for extra credit. You need to check in at least 21 of the 30 days to receive all of the extra credit.

# FAQ 

## Why do you need my location?

The only time the app sees your location is when you enter or exit the library. The app never receives your location at any other time. The app will not be able to determine where you live, when you leave campus, where you go off-campus, or even track your movement around campus.

We know that you may study at different places on campus, but to ensure your privacy, we will ONLY track the time that you study in the library, which is sufficient for this study.

# Consent to be a Research Subject

This is the information the app provides when you consent to be a research subject.

## Introduction

This research study is being conducted by Christopher Slade at Brigham Young University – Hawaii and Peter Washington at the University of Hawaii - Manoa to explore how mobile device usage affects your sleep and study habits. You were selected to participate because you are currently taking a class at BYU – Hawaii that is participating in this study.

## Procedures

After you consent to be a research subject by clicking on consent below, you will be asked for your permission for this device to collect location data and send notifications. To get the full amount of extra credit, you will need to make sure to check in with the app daily. At the end of the study, you can screenshot your participation report from the app and turn that in for your extra credit.

## Risks/Discomforts

There are minimal risks to you by participating in this study. However, you may worry about this app collecting personal information. This app will never collect any personally identifiable information, nor will the researchers of this study be able to specifically identify the data you have shared through the app as belonging to you. Your exact location will never be shared.

## Benefits

There are no direct benefits to subjects. However, it is hoped that through your participation researchers will learn more about mobile device usage and how applications can be developed to better support sleep and study habits.

## Confidentiality

All information provided will remain confidential and will only be reported as group data with no identifying information, especially since no identifying information is collected. All data will be securely stored using industry-standard technology. 

## Compensation

Participants will receive extra credit in your course. Your instructor will specify how much extra credit is available to earn and this information should be posted in Canvas or made available to you by your instructor. The amount of extra credit will be based on your full participation in the study as reported by the app. Your instructor will provide an alternative extra credit assignment equal to the amount of extra credit you can earn by participating in this study. This assignment will be posted in Canvas or otherwise provided by your instructor.

## Participation

Participation in this research study is voluntary. You have the right to withdraw at any time or refuse to participate entirely without jeopardy to your class status, grade, or standing with the university. If you choose to withdraw from this study, you will have the chance to complete another extra credit assignment to earn the same amount of extra credit provided by fully participating in this study.

## Results

The results of this study will not be provided to the participants.
