In coordination with the [Hawaii Digital Health lab](https://peterwashington.github.io) at the University of Hawaii - Manoa, we are conducting a study to see how screen time and study habits affect the mental health of college students. The health sensor app is designed to collect this data securely and privately.

# Privacy Policy 

Our number one priority is to make sure that your privacy is maintained throughout the study. To ensure your privacy, ALL DATA will be anynomous. The mobile app will generate a unique identifier for each participant, but there will be no way to connect that identifier with you (the participant). You cannot see the identifier within the app. Your name, email, course, or any other personally identifiable information will not be associated with this identifier.

# FAQ 

## Why do you need my location?
The only time the app sees your location is when you enter or exit the library. The app never receives your location at any other time. The app will not be able to determine where you live, when you leave campus, where you go off-campus, or even track your movement around campus.

We know that you may study at different places on campus, but to ensure your privacy, we will ONLY track the time that you study in the library, which is sufficient for this study.
