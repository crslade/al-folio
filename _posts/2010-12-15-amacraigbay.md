description: For the next Kynetx competition I decided to create AmaCraigBay. I have always talked to friends about how they got this really cool stuff from Craigslist for really cheap, or free. I never think to check Craigslist when I need something. I always pay full price. So, I figured I would put eBay and Craigslist results on Amazon search pages, that way whenever I am on Amazon looking for something, not only will I remember to check Craigslist and eBay, I will see the most popular item from each site right above Amazon's results.

For the next [Kynetx](http://kynetx.com/) [competition](http://code.kynetx.com/2010/12/06/conest-yql-kynetx-ends-dec-16th/) I decided to create AmaCraigBay. I have always talked to friends about how they got this really cool stuff from Craigslist for really cheap, or free. I never think to check Craigslist when I need something. I always pay full price. So, I figured I would put eBay and Craigslist results on Amazon search pages, that way whenever I am on Amazon looking for something, not only will I remember to check Craigslist and eBay, I will see the most popular item from each site right above Amazon's results.

I searched on Amazon for an iPad, and guess what, Craigslist beat both Amazon and eBay for the cheapest iPad (non-used) by almost $100 dollars. It's just an email and a short drive away. So if I don't win the competition, at least I can try my luck with Amazon, eBay, and Craigslist all in one page.

Here is a screenshot:

If you want to try it out, here are the browser extensions for Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. I haven't try the IE extension but it should work.

[Firefox](http://www.christopherslade.com/AmaCraigBay.xpi), [Chrome](http://www.christopherslade.com/AmaCraigBay.crx), [Internet Explorer](http://www.christopherslade.com/AmaCraigBay_Setup.exe)

If you prefer a Bookmarklet, just drag the link below to your bookmark toolbar, and press it when you are on an Amazon search page.

When you first visit Amazon, you should see a box asking you to enter your Craigslist city (this won't happen with the bookmarklet until after you press it).  Go to Craigslist and find your city.  Look at the URL and put the part between http:// and .craigslist.org in for your city.  You should see the results when you search (and if your using the bookmarklet, after you press the button on a search results page).  You need to accept 3rd Party cookies from kobj.net for it to remember your city.
