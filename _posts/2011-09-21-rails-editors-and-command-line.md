One of the first questions you will need to answer when starting with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), is what editor should you use.  For the mac, it has been [TextMate](http://macromates.com/).  I haven't really liked the IDE's for Ruby on Rails (although I never really used them).  So, I needed to find a good text editor for Windows.  Turns out [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) looks like the best one I was able to find.  It works in Windows, Mac, and in Linux.  It is a lot like TextMate, and might even surpass it in features.  I almost switched from TextMate to Sublime, but I didn't because the snippets and plugins aren't quite up to par with TextMate's.  However, if TextMate 2 doesn't come out soon, Sublime will probably surpass it soon.  Must-have features are snippets, and a sidebar file browser.  Both TextMate and Sublime have them.  (Of course, if you're a vi or emacs pro then stick with it.  None of my students are.)  My only question is, should my students pay for it?  I told them they should when they start making money using it.

I also notice that none of my students had any command line experience.  Thinking about it, I had to learn the command line (in Linux) in a Software Engineering class that made us learn Linux and C++ pretty much on our own and then write two substantial programs in C++.  Although frustrating at times, it turned out to be a very good class.  We never teach the command line in any of our classes.  I got a big blank stare when I mentioned make. The downside to only teaching with IDE's.  Luckily, I need to revamp my Operating Systems class.  Maybe I will make it a lot like my Software Engineering class.
