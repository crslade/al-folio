In my Ruby on Rails class, I created a [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmz7pZjxnS1XAnpk7lLyCRLbtCYaSNkpE) to help students learn Rails. I know there are a lot of tutorials out there, but a lot of them are done in older versions of Rails. There are quite a few breaking changes (like using rails db:migrage intead rake db:migrate), and when you are learning something new this can be really frustrating. 


I created a [Rails 6 tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmz7pZjxnS1VlA-k5qpji6aYDYys0MbIA) a few years ago when Rails 6 was released. I recently just redid the tutorial in Rails 7. All of the videos are posted on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk415givMQzyhe4Lmxg8o9w). I do not post the code because then students just copy and paste my code, which usually bypasses the learning process.
