description: I figured I should dedicate my first post to explaining why I decided to start a blog.  As a Computer Science professor, and a PhD student, I realized that I needed to practice my communication skills and get involved.  Although I would prefer to be strictly on the reading side of technology, in order to really be a part of it I need to contribute.  Hopefully this blog will the the perfect starting place.

I figured I should dedicate my first post to explaining why I decided to start a blog.  As a Computer Science professor, and a PhD student, I realized that I needed to practice my communication skills and get involved.  Although I would prefer to be strictly on the reading side of technology, in order to really be a part of it I need to contribute.  Hopefully this blog will the the perfect starting place.

Although I don't really consider myself a leading expert in technology or in teaching, I plan on sharing my thoughts and ideas on teaching technology -- thus my blog title **Tecno-pedagogia**.  I will also include my ideas on my PhD research in online collaboration and teaching, which gladly fits under the same topic.  Of course, I reserve the right to to post about any other topic that may be on my mind.

I encourage comments and ideas so please feel free to share.  All I ask is that you be respectful.
