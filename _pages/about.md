I am a Computer Science professor at BYU - Hawaii. I have been teaching since 2007. I focus on web application development but teach almost all CS subjects. I also develop web and mobile applications both for fun and on the side. Checkout my [portfolio page](/portfolio/) for more details.

I also do research in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning and Mobile Health Sensing.
